# cbioc

This is a project that I worked on while an undergrad at ASU.  I was a part of a team that included undergrad, grad, and post docs.  My primary function was integrating all of the work together into a server application written in Java and running on linux.

This repository contains any of the documents and files I still have from way back when in 2004-2008ish.
